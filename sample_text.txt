LangChain is a framework for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs).  It provides tools for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), agents, chains, and memory.  Developers use LangChain with vector databases such as FAISS, Pinecone, or Weaviate.  One common use case is document question answering, where the system answers user queries using company-specific data.
